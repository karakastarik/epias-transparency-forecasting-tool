# Forecasting and Visualization Tool

This tool is currently under development. The main purpose of this tool is to create a forecasting dashboard for EPIAS Transparency Platform using Python-Streamlit.

Data comes from [EPIAS Transparency Platform](https://seffaflik.epias.com.tr/transparency/index.xhtml) and updated hourly.

You can access the tool using this [link](https://share.streamlit.io/karakastarik/epias-transparency-forecasting-tool/app.py
). We are still working on the forecasting side and it will be live soon!
